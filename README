When running the application, the options are of the form (I1 and I2 represent image file
names):
> -a I1 I2 (add I1 and I2)
> -s I1 I2 (subtract I2 from I1)
> -i I1 (invert I1)
> -l I1 I2 (mask I1 with I2)
> -t I1 f (threshold I1 with integer value f)
The command line form will thus be:
	imageops <option> OutputImageName
where imageops is the name of your program, <option> represents the single
operation to be performed (see above) and OutputImageName is the name for
the result image. Note that only one option should be specified when you run the
program.
------------------------------------------------------------------
> Image.h contains the declarations of the Image and iterator classes
> Image.cpp contains all function/method definitions for both classes

> Imageops.cpp contains a main method and serves as the driver class

> The project can be compiled using 'make'
    > This creates an executable named 'imageops'

> Ouputted images will be created in the output/ directory

> Tests.cpp contains unit tests for all methods/functions found in Image and iterator
    > This can be compiled using 'make test', which will also run the tests

> 'make clean' removes all binary files
